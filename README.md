# Human-s-Pivotal-Stuffs-Sharing-Platform
  Wasting the essential things are the most challenging issue that is currently facing by the humankind in worldwide. Roughly, seven billion people in the world, an estimated 870 million suffer each day from hunger. The challenge is not a lack of food - it is making consistently available to everyone who needs it. 
  In existing system don’t have proper organized group to serve the food for the needy. Also, they are using mobile numbers to contact the volunteers. So it is hard to identify their location, because all volunteers aren’t connected socially. To overcome this problem, to form a network of volunteers, restaurants and NGO’s from various location to share the surplus things for less fortunate people. Specifying the accurate geographical location of nourishment site along with the details of respective things, makes the organization’s partition of stuffs over needy become simple. Particularly by adding the hunger spot, can also simply drive around the neighborhood to mark out the areas that have needy and help them as much as possible. This would be a right course of action to feed atleast four in every eight people who sleeps hungry at night. Sharing remnant things with needy will save their lives.
